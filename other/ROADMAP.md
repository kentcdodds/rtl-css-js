# Project Roadmap

## Want to do

- Cover all cases where it makes sense to convert an object from LTR to RTL or vice versa
- Handle traversal of objects (this is a really common CSS in JS pattern)

## Might do

- Make plugins for CSS in JS tools like [`glamor`](http://npm.im/glamor). Maybe that would live in a different repo though...

## Wont do

- Encode specifics of certain frameworks into the tool itself.
